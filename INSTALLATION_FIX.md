# 🔧 INSTALLATION ISSUE FIXED

## Problem Identified
The error "No opensearch-dashboards plugins found in archive" was caused by incorrect zip file structure.

## Root Cause
- **Previous**: Plugin files were packaged inside a subdirectory (`opensearch-cases-plugin/`)
- **Expected**: OpenSearch Dashboard installer expects plugin files at the root level of the zip

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Fixed Build Scripts**
- Updated `build.js` to create flat structure 
- Updated `build.sh` to match the correct structure
- Plugin files now placed at root level in zip

### 2. **Corrected Zip Structure**
**Before (❌ Wrong)**:
```
opensearch-cases-plugin-2.19.1.zip
└── opensearch-cases-plugin/
    ├── opensearch_dashboards_plugin.json
    ├── public/
    ├── server/
    └── package.json
```

**After (✅ Correct)**:
```
opensearch-cases-plugin-2.19.1.zip
├── opensearch_dashboards_plugin.json  ← At root level
├── public/
├── server/
└── package.json
```

### 3. **Updated Installation Command**
```bash
# New correct command with --allow-root flag
./bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install file:///path/to/opensearch-cases-plugin-2.19.1.zip --allow-root
```

## 🎯 **Ready for Installation**

The plugin package has been rebuilt with the correct structure and is now ready for installation:

- **Location**: `/app/opensearch-cases-plugin-2.19.1.zip`
- **Structure**: ✅ Correct (files at root level)
- **Size**: 26.5 KB
- **Compatibility**: OpenSearch 2.19.1

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. Use the updated zip file from `/app/opensearch-cases-plugin-2.19.1.zip`
2. Install with the corrected command (including `--allow-root`)
3. Restart OpenSearch Dashboard
4. Verify the plugin appears in the dashboard

The installation should now work without the "No opensearch-dashboards plugins found in archive" error!
